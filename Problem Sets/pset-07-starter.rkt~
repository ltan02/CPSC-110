(@htdd Letters)
;; Letters is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons String Letters)
;; interp. a sequence of letters
;; CONSTRAINT: every string in the sequence is only one letter

(define L1 empty)
(define L2 (list "a" "B" "c"))

(@htdd Operations)
;; Operations is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons "keep" Operations)
;; - (cons "space" Operations)
;; - (cons "remove" Operations)
;; interp. a sequence of operations to apply to a sequence of letters
;;         "keep"   means keep    the corresponding letter
;;         "space"  means replace the corresponding letter with a space   
;;         "remove" means remove  the corresponding letter

;;
;; In this problem you will design a function called decoder, that will
;; decode encrypted messages! Very poorly encrypted messages.  The function
;; consumes a Letters (l) and Operations (ops) in that order. The function
;; should produce a String which is the result of applying the given
;; operations to the successive and joining the resulting letters
;; together.
;;
;; For example:
;; (decoder (list "i" "k" "l" "h" "a" "m" "k" "s" "a" "r" "m")
;;          (list "keep" "remove" "remove" "space" "keep" "keep"
;;                "space" "keep" "keep" "remove"))
;;
;; should produce "i am sam"
;;
;; Notice that some of the letters were kept, some were replaced with a space,
;; and some were removed.
;; 
;; If ops runs out of operations before the end of the letters, then all 
;; the remaining letters in l are kept.
;;
;; If l runs out of letters first, then the remaining operations in ops are
;; ignored.
;;
;; Example 2:
;; (decoder (list "f" "a" "d" "e")
;;          (list "remove" "keep" "space" "keep" "remove" "keep" "space"))
;;
;; should produce "a e"
;;
;; You must solve this as a 2-one-of problem and your solution must include
;; a table. You should show the correspondence between table cells and
;; cond QA pairs. By this, we mean you should NUMBER the table cells and NUMBER
;; the corresponding cond QA pairs with the same numbers (as was done in
;; lecture). If you can simplify the table you should.  Finally, it is 
;; IMPERATIVE that your cond questions only include the kinds of questions that 
;; the data driven template rules produce, other conditional behaviour must go
;; into the cond answers. (This is the rule about not editing template questions
;; carried over into 2-one-of problems.)
