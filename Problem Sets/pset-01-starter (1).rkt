;; Write the BSL expression that most clearly represents the following
;; arithmetic expression:
;;
;;     3^2 + 6 * (6 - 10) / 3
;;
;; which equals 1
;;
;; There is a single BSL expression that both produces the correct result, 
;; and most closely matches the structure of the equation given above.
;; Although 1 is an expression that evaluates to 1, that is not the
;; correct answer, because it doesn't show the structure of the expression
