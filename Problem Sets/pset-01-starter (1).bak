(@problem 1)
;;
;; Write the BSL expression that most clearly represents the following
;; arithmetic expression:
;;
;;     3^2 + 6 * (6 - 10) / 3
;;
;; which equals 1
;;
;; There is a single BSL expression that both produces the correct result, 
;; and most closely matches the structure of the equation given above.
;; Although 1 is an expression that evaluates to 1, that is not the
;; correct answer, because it doesn't show the structure of the expression
;; above.
;;






(@problem 2)
;;
;; Given the definitions below (LOWER, UPPER and foo),
;; write the step-by-step evaluation of the following expression:
;;
;;     (foo (* 3 4) (+ 0 2))
;;
;; Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step, including the original
;; expression and the final result.  The steps should NOT be in comments.

;; First uncomment the expression, then fix it.

;; When you are done, do NOT add the semi-colon back to the beginning

;; Skye has now written a function that is supposed to produce the given image
;; with a caption underneath it. Please correct the expression below so that

;; First uncomment the expression, then fix it.

;; NOTE: Do not attempt to solve this problem until you have covered
;; the How to Design Functions (HtDF) design recipe in lecture.
;;
;; Design a function called taller-image that consumes two images and produces
;; the image that has the greater height.
;;
;; Note that the template tag for a function that consumes two images is:
;;
;; (@template Image)
;;
;; and the template itself is:
;;
;; (define (taller-image i1 i2)
;;   (... i1 i2))
