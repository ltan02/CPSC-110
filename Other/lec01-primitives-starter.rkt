;; Problem:
;; 
;; Remember that the equation for the lengths of the sides in a
;; right triangle is:
;; 
;;   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
;; 
;;   c = sqrt ( a^2  +  b ^2) 
;; 
;; Write an expression to compute the length of side c when a is 3
;; and b is 4.  The name of the primitive that computes the square
;; root of a number is sqrt.

;; Problem:

;; The background for the Canadian Flag (without the maple leaf) is two
;; red bands on either side of a white band. Write an expression to produce that
;; background. If you want to get the details right, officially the overall flag
;; has proportions 1:2, and the band widths are in the ratio 1:2:1.
