;; Design a function, called topple, that takes an image and rotates it 
;; by 90 degrees.
;;




(@problem 2)
;;
;; Design a function that consumes the name of something and produces a
;; "checkbox line" image that allows someone to check off that item.  For 
;; example (checkbox-line "apples") would produce an image with a small
;; check box next to the word apples.
