;; We are now going to turn back to sorting

;;
;; Here's the idea:
;;  If we have to sort a list, we will first make the problem
;;  smaller by breaking it into two lists, sort them, and then
;;  put them back together. 
;;
;;  We will break it in two lists by taking the first element -- 
;;  which we call the PIVOT, and then filtering out two lists, one
;;  w/ elements less than the pivot and one w/ elements greater
;;  than the pivot. Once those lists are sorted, we can append
;;  the < list, a list consisting of just the pivot and the >
;;  list back back together to get the result.
;;
;;                   (list 6 8 1 9 3 7 2) 
;;                   /         |        \
;;                  /          |         \
;;        (list 1 3 2)         6        (list 8 9 7)
;;         /  |  \                         /    |    \
;;        /   |   \                       /     |     \
;;     empty  1 (list 3 2)          (list 7)    8    (list 9)
;;                /  |  \             / | \           /  |  \
;;               /   |   \           /  |  \         /   |   \
;;          (list 2) 3  empty     empty 7 empty    empty 9  empty
;;           /     \
;;        empty   empty  
;; This way of sorting is called QUICKSORT. It is a generative
