;; PROBLEM:
;;
;; Design a function called sequence? that consumes a list of natural numbers
;; and produces true if the list is a sequence, meaning each number is 1 larger
;; than the number before it.  You may assume the list has at least one element.
;; So:
;;    (sequence? (list 2 3 4))  ==> true
;;    (sequence? (list 3 5 6))  ==> false
