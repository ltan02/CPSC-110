;; node with that name.

;;
;; PROBLEM
;;
;; Define a new version of the function which is tail recursive.  You only
;; need a new function definition. Proceed by
;;   - copying your solution to the problem above
;;   - and renaming the path accumulator to visited
;;   - then convert the code to be tail recursive
