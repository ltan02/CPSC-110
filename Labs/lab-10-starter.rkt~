;; Problem 2:

;; When spelling correction first appeared in typewriters, it was very important
;; to store the information about legal words as compactly as possible. One
;; technique for doing so was to use prefix trees, in which all words that start
;; with the same prefix share the same data representation for that common
;; prefix. They only have different data for their different endings. For
;; example, part of the prefix tree starting at t would look like this: 

#;
(bitmap/url
 "https://edx-course-spdx-kiczales.s3.amazonaws.com/HTC/lab/lab-10-prefix-tree.png")


;; Of course, the complete tree starting at t is much bigger.

;; Each node in the prefix tree has its letter and a flag indicating whether the
;; path from the root of the tree to that node is a legal node. In the picture,
;; the * on some nodes indicate that the tree up to that point is a legal word.
;; For example, the sequence of letters t-o-o is a legal word because when we
;; start from t, then to o, then to the second o, we are a node with *. But the
;; sequence t-o-u is not legal because going from t, then o, then u lands at a
;; node without *. Every full path is a legal word because it would waste space
;; to store bad words that you don't need.


;; Design a function called count-odds that takes a prefix spelling tree
;; and determines how many odd-length words are contained in it. 

;; We have provided the data definition for prefix trees below.

;; Problem 3:

;; Copy your function design from Task 1 and change it to produce a list of 
;; the binary digits on the path to a given string in the tree, or false if  
;; that string cannot be reached in the given tree. Use a result-so-far
;; accumulator. Call this function encode.
(@problem 3)





;; EXTRA PRACTICE:

;; Refactor your design of encode from Problem 3 so it is also tail recursive.
;; Note that you will want to keep a copy of your solution from Problem 3 to
;; hand in.
